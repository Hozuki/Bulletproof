# What is danmaku

This page contains a concise history of danmaku and its applications.

"Danmaku" (弾幕) is a Japanese word for "live comment", a way online video watchers interact with each other.

The meaning, coming from [bullet hell](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell), is an analogy of "live" comments going through the video player like barrages. The original meaning of "danmaku" in Japanese is exactly "barrage".

Videos with danmakus started from [NicoNico](http://www.nicovideo.jp/), where watchers prefer sending comments immediatly after some interesting contents appear in the video. These comments are labeled with timestamp, so they will appear at the same time the commenter sended it when another person watches the video. Now there are some other danmaku video website besides NicoNico: [AcFun](http://www.acfun.tv/), [BiliBili](http://www.bilibili.com/).

For example, in a comedy, the host tells a joke at 03:10 in the video. A watcher A likes this joke, so he sends a comment "Oh so funny" at 03:12 of the video. If a watcher B watches the same video after A's comment is sent, and B will see "Oh so funny" when the video comes to 03:12. As you can see, there may be a delay between video (03:10) and comment (03:12), because it takes time to type the content and click the "send" button.

Danmaku video websites use their own web players, just like Youtube. These players are dedicated for presenting danmakus while playing videos, and they might support different kinds of danmakus. With support provided by the players, a skilled danamku maker can write programs, or use advanced functions of the players, to create special danmakus.

Soon after the websites went online, curious developers and artists began to try the features, to show their skills. These actions bring danmaku to a height of art form. Apart from oridinary danmakus, people created motion images (usually intending to represent a video), tiny games, and splendid visual effects using advanced danmaku techniques. The works need lots of preparation and implementation, so they are quite rare.

Danmaku also has its etiquette. From simple danmakus to advanced danmakus, their existence are mean to be the spice of the main dish.
