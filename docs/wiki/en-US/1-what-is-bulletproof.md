# What is Bulletproof

<del>Technically, nothing is bulletproof, even kevlar. Think about projectiles with huge mass and high speed, they are unstoppable!</del>

Bulletproof is a danmaku render engine built on HTML5 technologies.

The underlying functions are supported by [GLantern](//github.com/Hozuki/GLantern). Bulletproof handles danmaku management and layout.

The name "Bulletproof" comes from a famous line in [Gundam XX](): "Firepower is not enough on the left flank of the starship!" This sentence is also the origin of the "live comment" meaning of word "danmaku". In order to survive the fierce firepower, we must be... well, bulletproof.
